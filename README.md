# New-Sidescroller
# WHAT:
I am creating a personal sidescroller video game. The goal is to make the sidescroller game feel more like something I would design myself.
# WHY:
Sidescrollers are always fun for everyone, and I'd like to leave my mark on them.
# WHO:

My game is based on: https://github.com/Marishwaran99/sidescroller
